Seems smarter to keep these lightweight shell scripts in one umbrella repository than to make a repo for each one.

  10/28/11:
  - Moved Harvest here. Further updates will happen in this repo.
  - Added extract_draw.sh, a utility for converting the output of the AI->Canvas Plug-In for Illustrator into JavaScript that I can easily turn into drawing instructions.
  - Got my hands dirty with sed for the first time today.
