Shell scripts
=============

Seems smarter to keep these lightweight shell scripts in one umbrella repository than to make a repo for each one.

Harvest
-------

This bash script identifies audio CDs and copies their contents to an archive directory.


Cel Helper
----------

A utility for converting the output of the AI->Canvas Plug-In for Illustrator into JavaScript drawing instructions. I'm using it in tandem with my animation library.
